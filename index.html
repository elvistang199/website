					<p>	As a 26-year-old Computer Engineering graduate from Cal Poly Pomona with Vietnamese immigrant parents, my life is a beautiful blend of diverse experiences, academic accomplishments, and personal passions. Having completed my degree, I find myself equipped with a deep understanding of computer systems and the constant technological advancements that shape our world. Growing up in a Vietnamese household has greatly influenced my values and work ethic. My parents instilled in me a sense of perseverance and a strong appreciation for family ties. I carry these values with me in every aspect of my life, including my career. One of my greatest passions at the current moment is cybersecurity and coding. I am looking to eventually become a software engineer or a cybersecurity professional. I finished studying the Google Cybersecurity course on Coursera and now studying for my CompTIA Security+ SY0-701. When I'm not engrossed in the world of coding, I find solace in the gym. Regular workouts have become an integral part of my routine, not just for physical fitness but also for mental well-being. Pushing my limits and setting personal fitness goals help me cultivate discipline and perseverance, traits that transcend the gym and positively impact other areas of my life. I also have a love for creating music as well. I use GarageBand on my Iphone to make. and make lyrics. I also used the DAW, FL Studio as well when I am at home and have free time to make a fully fleshed out song. I made one project so far and you can find it on my SoundCloud. The project is an EP and it is called Hiatus/ And of course, there's my love for gaming, particularly the popular online multiplayer game, League of Legends. Within its virtual realm, I find an escape, a way to unwind and connect with friends. Engaging in competitive gameplay challenges my strategic thinking, teamwork skills, and quick decision-making abilities. It's not just a pastime; it's a space where I can continually develop and refine my cognitive abilities.
